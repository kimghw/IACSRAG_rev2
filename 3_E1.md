##### 6.3.2 Number of external supply sources

When external source of supply is necessary for auxiliary circuits, at least two external sources of supply are to be provided and so arranged that a failure or loss of one source will not cause the loss of more than one generator set and/or set of essential services.

Where necessary one source of supply is to be from the emergency source of electrical power for the start up from dead ship condition.

#### 6.4 High voltage test

A power-frequency voltage test is to be carried out on any switchgear and controlgear assemblies. The test procedure and voltages are to be according to the IEC 62271-200:2011 section 7/ routine test.

In accommodation spaces, high voltage cables are to be run in enclosed cable transit systems.

##### 7.2.2 Segregation

High voltage cables are to be segregated from cables operating at different voltage ratings each other; in particular, they are not to be run in the same cable bunch, nor in the same ducts or pipes, or, in the same box.

Where high voltage cables of different voltage ratings are installed on the same cable tray, the air clearance between cables is not to be less than the minimum air clearance for the higher voltage side in 2.3.1. However, high voltage cables are not to be installed on the same cable tray for the cables operating at the nominal system voltage of 1 kV and less.

##### 7.2.3 Installation arrangements

High voltage cables, in general, are to be installed on cable trays when they are provided with a continuous metallic sheath or armour which is effectively bonded to earth; otherwise they are to be installed for their entire length in metallic castings effectively bonded to earth.

##### 7.2.4 Terminations

Terminations in all conductors of high voltage cables are to be, as far as practicable, effectively covered with suitable insulating material. In terminal boxes, if conductors are not insulated, phases are to be separated from earth and from each other by substantial barriers of suitable insulating materials.

High voltage cables of the radial field type, i.e. having a conductive layer to control the electric field within the insulation, are to have terminations which provide electric stress control.

Terminations are to be of a type compatible with the insulation and jacket material of the cable and are to be provided with means to ground all metallic shielding components (i.e. tapes, wires etc).

##### 7.2.5 Marking

High voltage cables are to be readily identifiable by suitable marking.

##### 7.2.6 Test after installation

Before a new high voltage cable installation, or an addition to an existing installation, is put into service a voltage withstand test is to be satisfactorily carried out on each completed cable and its accessories.

The test is to be carried out after an insulation resistance test.

For cables with rated voltage (U₀/U) above 1.8/3 kV (Um =3.6 kV) an a.c. voltage withstand test may be carried out upon advice from high voltage cable manufacturer. One of the following test methods to be used:
a) test for 5 min with the phase-to-phase voltage of the system applied between the conductor and the metallic screen/sheath.
b) test for 24 h with the normal operating voltage of the system.

Alternatively, a d.c. test voltage equal to 4 Uo may be applied for 15 minutes.

For cables with rated voltage (U₀/U) up to 1.8/3 kV (Um =3.6 kV) a d.c. voltage equal to 4 Uo shall be applied for 15 minutes.

After completion of the test, the conductors are to be connected to earth for a sufficient period in order to remove any trapped electric charge.

An insulation resistance test is then repeated.

##### 4.1.2 Visual inspection

A visual examination is to be made of the machine to ensure, as far as is practicable, that it complies with technical documentation.

#### 4.2 Insulation resistance measurement

Immediately after the high voltage tests the insulation resistances are to be measured using a direct current insulation tester between:
a) all current carrying parts connected together and earth,
b) all current carrying parts of different polarity or phase, where both ends of each polarity or phase are individually accessible.

The minimum values of test voltages and corresponding insulation resistances are given in Table 2. The insulation resistance is to be measured close to the operating temperature, or an appropriate method of calculation is to be used.

**Table 2**

| Related Voltage Un (V) | Minimum Test Voltage (V) | Test Minimum Insulation Resistance (MΩ) |
|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Un ≤ 250 | 2 x Un | 1 |
| 250 < Un ≤ 1000 | 500 | 1 |
| 1000 < Un ≤ 7200 | 1000 | (Un / 1000) + 1 |
| 7200 < Un ≤ 15000 | 5000 | (Un / 1000) + 1 |

#### 4.3 Winding resistance measurement

The resistances of the machine windings are to be measured and recorded using an appropriate bridge method or voltage and current method.

#### 4.4 Verification of the voltage regulation system

The alternating current generator, together with its voltage regulation system shall, at all loads from no-load running to full load, be able to keep rated voltage at the rated power factor under steady conditions within ± 2.5%. These limits may be increased to ± 3.5% for emergency sets.

When the generator is driven at rated speed, giving its rated voltage, and is subjected to a sudden change of symmetrical load within the limits of specified current and power factor, the voltage is not to fall below 85% nor exceed 120% of the rated voltage.

The voltage of the generator is then to be restored to within plus or minus 3% of the rated voltage for the main generator sets in not more than 1.5 s. For emergency sets, these values may be increased to plus or minus 4% in not more than 5 s, respectively.

In the absence of precise information concerning the maximum values of the sudden loads, the following conditions may be assumed: 60% of the rated current with a power factor of between 0.4 lagging and zero to be suddenly switched on with the generator running at no load, and then switched off after steady - state conditions have been reached. Subject to Classification Society's approval, such voltage regulation during transient conditions may be calculated values based on the previous type test records, and need not to be tested during factory testing of a generator.

#### 4.5 Rated load test and temperature rise measurements

The temperature rises are to be measured at the rated output, voltage, frequency and the duty for which the machine is rated and marked in accordance with the testing methods specified in IEC 60034-1:2017, or by means of a combination of other tests.

The limits of temperature rise are those specified in the relevant table of IEC 60034-1:2017 adjusted as necessary for the ambient reference temperatures specified in UR M40.

#### 4.6 Overload/overcurrent tests

Overload test is to be carried out as a type test for generators as a proof of overload capability of generators and excitation system, for motors as a proof of momentary excess torque as required in IEC 60034-1:2017. The overload test can be replaced at routine test by the overcurrent test. The over current test shall be the proof of current capability of windings, wires, connections etc. of each machine. The overcurrent test can be done at reduced speed (motors) or at short circuit (generators).

#### 4.7 Verification of steady short-circuit conditions

It is to be verified that under steady-state short-circuit conditions, the generator with its voltage regulating system is capable of maintaining, without sustaining any damage, a current of at least three times the rated current for a duration of at least 2 s or, where precise data is available, for a duration of any time delay which will be fitted in the tripping device for discrimination purposes.

In order to provide sufficient information to the party responsible for determining the discrimination settings in the distribution system where the generator is going to be used, the generator manufacturer shall provide documentation showing the transient behaviour of the short circuit current upon a sudden short-circuit occurring when excited, and running at nominal speed. The influence of the automatic voltage regulator shall be taken into account, and the setting parameters for the voltage regulator shall be noted together with the decrement curve. Such a decrement curve shall be available when the setting of the distribution system's short-circuit protection is calculated. The decrement curve need not be based on physical testing. The manufacturer's simulation model for the generator and the voltage regulator may be used where this has been validated through the previous type test on the same model.

#### 4.8 Overspeed test

Machines are to withstand the overspeed test as specified in to IEC 60034-1:2017. This test is not applicable for squirrel cage motors.

#### 4.9 Dielectric strength test

Machines are to withstand a dielectric test as specified in IEC 60034-1:2017.

For high voltage machine an impulse test is to be carried out on the coils according to UR E11.

#### 4.10 No load test

Machines are to be operated at no load and rated speed whilst being supplied at rated voltage and frequency as a motor or if a generator it is to be driven by a suitable means and excited to give rated terminal voltage.

During the running test, the vibration of the machine and operation of the bearing lubrication system, if appropriate, are to be checked.

#### 4.11 Verification of degree of protection

As specified in IEC 60034-5:2000+AMD1:2006.

#### 4.12 Verification of bearings

Upon completion of the above tests, machines which have sleeve bearings are to be opened upon request for examination by the Classification Society Surveyor, to establish that the shaft is correctly seated in the bearing shells.
